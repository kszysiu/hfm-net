HFM.NET is written in Microsoft C# and is developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

If you do not have Visual Studio 2010 Professional or better you can download the free Visual Studio 2010 
C# Express edition here:

Compiling within Visual Studio
------------------------------

There are two solutions files available in the source control repository beneath the \src folder.

- HFM.sln:     This solution file contains all the projects necessary to build the HFM.NET distribution.
- HFM.All.sln: This solution file contains everything in the above solution plus the HFM.NET tools and
               NUnit unit test projects.

If you simply want to build the latest version of HFM.NET then all you need to do is compile the projects
in the HFM.sln file.

If you want to make your own changes to HFM.NET then I suggest you load the HFM.All.sln file so you can 
validate your changes using the HFM.NET unit test projects.

There are several options available for executing NUnit (http://www.nunit.org/) unit tests.

- The easiest is to use the built-in NUnit test runner available in the source code repository:

  \lib\NUnit\bin\net-2.0\nunit.exe
  \lib\NUnit\bin\net-2.0\nunit-x86.exe

- TestDriven.Net is a great tool and available here (free):  http://www.testdriven.net/
- I personally use ReSharper from JetBrains (commercial):    http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/

Compiling with the HFM.NET MSBuild Script
-----------------------------------------

The HFM.NET MSBuild Script is setup to build HFM.NET in Release mode and automatically run all the NUnit
unit test projects.  On a successful compile, the script will copy the distribution files to a the 
\src\Artifacts\HFM.NET folder.

Although HFM.NET is compiled to run under with the Microsoft.NET Framework v3.5 it is built using the 
Microsoft.NET Framework v4.0 toolset.  It will likely build fine using the Microsoft.NET Framework v3.5 
toolset but this configuration is not supported.

To execute the build script you still need a version of Visual Studio 2010 installed.  Open a Visual Studio
2010 Command Prompt by going to the Start menu > Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 > Visual Studio Tools >
Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010).  If you're using Visual Studio 2010 Express you will need to open a
standard command propmt and execute the msbuild engine from either of the following two locations depending
on OS platform.

- 32-bit: C:\WINDOWS\microsoft.net\Framework\v4.0.30319
- 64-bit: C:\WINDOWS\microsoft.net\Framework64\v4.0.30319

You can execute the build script from the \src folder as seen below.  Note that the version of the msbuild
engine is echoed in the command prompt.

C:\...\src>C:\WINDOWS\microsoft.net\Framework64\v4.0.30319\msbuild HFM.msbuild
Microsoft (R) Build Engine Version 4.0.30319.1
