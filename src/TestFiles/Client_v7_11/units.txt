    "description": "This project involves additional sampling of the FiP35 WW domain shot from the ultra-long trajectories run by DE Shaw on their new supercomputer ANTON. We are testing the differences between these new ultra-long trajectories and shorter ones from FAH, to test how simulations run on FAH stack up to more traditional methods.
